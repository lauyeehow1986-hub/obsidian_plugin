# Changelog

All notable changes to SCDB Cockpit. Governance-gate changes get their own
clearly marked entry (CLAUDE.md §10).

## Unreleased

Phase A1: request tracking. The domain layer — pure, Obsidian-free, unit-tested.

### Added
- Workflow spec loader (§5.2): validates stages, transitions, gates and the
  `retired:` mapping, reporting problems rather than throwing.
- Transition engine with structural refusals (unknown stage, wrong workflow
  version, leaving a terminal stage) and gate refusals, each with a
  plain-English reason. Structural refusals are not overridable.
- Dwell maths (§5.1): current dwell, cumulative age, turnaround, per-stage
  roll-up, bounce and revisit counts, SLA state, and median dwell per stage.
  All computed from `history`, never stored.
- Request intake: ULID `uid`, `REQ-YYYY-NNN` label allocation with an owner
  segment for a future second allocator.
- Holdup views: by stage, by blocking party, and aged/breaching.
- Audit ledger (§5.6): append-only rows, SHA-256 hash chain seeded across month
  boundaries, chain verification that names the first row not to reconcile, and
  correction entries.
- Pure-TypeScript SHA-256, verified against the NIST vectors, so chain values
  are identical on every surface the plugin runs on.
- One timestamp parser and one duration formatter for the whole plugin.
- 176 further tests; 207 in total.

### Added — the vault and UI half
- Workflow store reading `_config/workflows/*.yaml` through Obsidian's core
  `parseYaml`, reloading when a spec file changes.
- In-memory request index built from the metadata cache and updated
  incrementally on change, rename and delete.
- Audit ledger writer: monthly files in `82 Audit/`, appends serialised through
  a queue, chain seeded from the previous month, and
  `SCDB: Verify audit ledger` reporting the first row that does not reconcile.
- Cockpit view with four boards — Queue (by stage), Holdup (by blocking
  person), Ageing, and Health (median dwell per stage, spec problems, notes
  that need attention).
- Request detail dialog: dwell, age, bounce count, time per stage, evidence
  with verbal records marked, and the full history.
- Stage-change dialog showing every gate live, with the override reason field
  appearing only when an override is possible and required before the button
  enables.
- Intake dialog and `SCDB: New request`; also `SCDB: Move this request to
  another stage` and `SCDB: Rebuild the request index`.
- Semantic status palette in `styles.css`, resolved through Obsidian's theme
  variables. Status is always a glyph and a word as well as a colour.
- Six synthetic request fixtures in the test vault covering a fresh request, an
  evidenced identifiable extraction, a bounced request, a completed one and a
  lapsed-approval case.
- The smoke test now runs `onload` against a stub App, so wiring errors are
  caught before a build travels.

### Added — the migration view
- **Migration board** (§5.2), completing A1. Any request whose
  `workflow_version` is behind its spec, or whose stage the spec no longer
  lists, is quarantined from stage actions and listed here: old stage →
  proposed new stage, every proposal editable, applied in bulk, nothing written
  until Apply. `SCDB: Migrate requests to the current workflow version` opens
  the cockpit on it, and a stranded request carries a "migrate" chip on every
  board so it is visible where the work happens.
- A migration entry is written to `history` marked `migration: true`, and
  `schema-migration` to the audit ledger naming both versions and the mapping.
- Two further synthetic fixtures: one stranded by a stage rename, one sitting
  in a stage the spec dropped without a mapping. The test-vault spec is now v2
  with a `retired:` entry, so the board has something real to show.
- 24 further tests; 231 in total.

### Changed
- `minAppVersion` raised to 1.6.0: `Vault.process` is used for append-only
  writes and arrived in that release. Keeping it honest matters more than
  claiming reach we do not have.
- The placeholder DUA gate now reads `governance.dua_signed == true` rather
  than the raw status field, so it actually requires an evidence record.
- The placeholder delivery gate now also requires `delivery_method`.

### Governance rules implemented
- **A gate override requires a typed reason.** Refusing to give one cancels the
  override — enforced in the engine, not only in the UI.
- **A `status: signed` does not satisfy a gate on its own.** It needs a
  non-verbal evidence record behind it (§5.5).
- **Verbal evidence never satisfies a hard gate**, and is surfaced as a warning
  wherever it appears.
- **A gate atom that cannot be evaluated refuses.** An unreadable or mistyped
  field never passes.
- **A request behind the workflow spec version is quarantined** from stage
  changes until it is migrated.
- **Migration never silently remaps.** The spec proposes a target only when the
  stage id is still live or `retired:` maps it. Any other target — including
  every choice for a stage the spec dropped — requires a typed reason, which is
  written to the ledger against each request in the batch.
- **Migration does not evaluate governance gates**, deliberately: a gate guards
  entry to a stage as a governance decision, while a migration relabels a stage
  the request is already in. Running gates would strand a request permanently
  whenever a gate was added after it arrived.
- **A note recording a spec version newer than the installed one is never
  rewritten.** It is listed, with the reason, and left alone.

### Notes
- A migration relabels the occupancy a request is already in rather than
  starting a new one, so renaming a stage does not reset a dwell clock, invent
  a segment in the median-dwell statistics, or register as a bounce.
- SLA targets are counted in **calendar days**. Whether the institutional eData
  SLAs are working days is an open question (CLAUDE.md §11); `daysBetween` is
  the single place to change it.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-31

Phase A0: scaffold. No user-facing capability yet.

### Added
- Build toolchain: TypeScript (strict), esbuild, Preact + htm with JSX.
- `npm run package` produces the three-file sneakernet release zip.
- Settings schema with versioning and a migration path, including refusal to
  overwrite settings written by a newer build.
- ULID generation for the immutable `uid` every note will carry.
- Synthetic test vault with a placeholder eData workflow spec.
- Vitest over `domain/`; 31 tests.
- `npm run smoke` loads the built bundle against a stubbed Obsidian module,
  catching load failures without opening Obsidian. Gates `npm run package`.

### Notes
- The eData workflow in `test-vault/_config/workflows/` is a **placeholder**.
  Real stage names, owners and gates replace it before any real use.
