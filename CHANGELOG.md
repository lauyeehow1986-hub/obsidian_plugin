# Changelog

All notable changes to SCDB Cockpit. Governance-gate changes get their own
clearly marked entry (CLAUDE.md §10).

## Unreleased

Phase A1: request tracking. The domain layer — pure, Obsidian-free, unit-tested.

### Added
- Workflow spec loader (§5.2): validates stages, transitions, gates and the
  `retired:` mapping, reporting problems rather than throwing.
- Transition engine with structural refusals (unknown stage, wrong workflow
  version, leaving a terminal stage) and gate refusals, each with a
  plain-English reason. Structural refusals are not overridable.
- Dwell maths (§5.1): current dwell, cumulative age, turnaround, per-stage
  roll-up, bounce and revisit counts, SLA state, and median dwell per stage.
  All computed from `history`, never stored.
- Request intake: ULID `uid`, `REQ-YYYY-NNN` label allocation with an owner
  segment for a future second allocator.
- Holdup views: by stage, by blocking party, and aged/breaching.
- Audit ledger (§5.6): append-only rows, SHA-256 hash chain seeded across month
  boundaries, chain verification that names the first row not to reconcile, and
  correction entries.
- Pure-TypeScript SHA-256, verified against the NIST vectors, so chain values
  are identical on every surface the plugin runs on.
- One timestamp parser and one duration formatter for the whole plugin.
- 176 further tests; 207 in total.

### Governance rules implemented
- **A gate override requires a typed reason.** Refusing to give one cancels the
  override — enforced in the engine, not only in the UI.
- **A `status: signed` does not satisfy a gate on its own.** It needs a
  non-verbal evidence record behind it (§5.5).
- **Verbal evidence never satisfies a hard gate**, and is surfaced as a warning
  wherever it appears.
- **A gate atom that cannot be evaluated refuses.** An unreadable or mistyped
  field never passes.
- **A request behind the workflow spec version is quarantined** from stage
  changes until it is migrated.

### Notes
- SLA targets are counted in **calendar days**. Whether the institutional eData
  SLAs are working days is an open question (CLAUDE.md §11); `daysBetween` is
  the single place to change it.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-31

Phase A0: scaffold. No user-facing capability yet.

### Added
- Build toolchain: TypeScript (strict), esbuild, Preact + htm with JSX.
- `npm run package` produces the three-file sneakernet release zip.
- Settings schema with versioning and a migration path, including refusal to
  overwrite settings written by a newer build.
- ULID generation for the immutable `uid` every note will carry.
- Synthetic test vault with a placeholder eData workflow spec.
- Vitest over `domain/`; 31 tests.
- `npm run smoke` loads the built bundle against a stubbed Obsidian module,
  catching load failures without opening Obsidian. Gates `npm run package`.

### Notes
- The eData workflow in `test-vault/_config/workflows/` is a **placeholder**.
  Real stage names, owners and gates replace it before any real use.
